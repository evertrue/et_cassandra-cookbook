# YAML topology configuration file for Cassandra,
# to be used with YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch.

# The topology, as a list of data centers.
#
# Each data center has a name and a list of racks.
#
# Each rack has a name and a list of nodes.
#
# Each node has a broadcast address (required)
# and a data-center-local address (optional).
# If dc_local_address is specified, its peers
# in the same data center will attempt to
# reconnect over that address instead.
